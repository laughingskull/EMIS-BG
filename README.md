NB!! I personally experienced problems with trying to open an Excel file with 100000 rows.
     However, the programme works fine with up to 10000 rows (which was the limit to which I tested)
	 I am not sure whether the problem when trying to open a 100000 rows file lies in Excel, or in the programme itself.
	 Therefore, if the programme doesn't work with this high amount of rows, please test it with a lower one! :)
	 
Python 3.5.2 was used for the creation of the programmes for the solutions of both tasks.

The solutions should be fairly obvious from the code itself for anyone with programming experience, as I have included explanatory comments. 
Still, if you have any questions, please contact me at alexpan@abv.bg

The solution for Task 1 uses the freeware OpenPyXL library for Python, which can be found at https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/default/

Download the package, then install through the command line using the command 'pip install openpyxl' (without the quotes)

For instructions on how to use pip for the Python platform, see here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip

Estimated time for solving the tasks:
Task 1 - 2.5 hours, INCLUDING looking for appropriate information and studying the OpenPyXL library and its functions and methods.
Task 2 - 20 minutes
